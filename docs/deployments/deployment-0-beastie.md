# Deployment #0 — Beastie

The first hive-owned deployment (deployment spec §7). Proves the generic compose
profile on hive hardware nobody hand-built, before any agent lands on it. Substrate
only: Postgres + migrations + the omegahive gateway-library image. **No agent
container, no outbound capability, no credentials beyond the DB role** (§7 non-goals).

**Status:** acceptance + deployment checks 1–5 green (Jul 7 2026). Backup drilled;
scheduled timer pending operator enable (see §Backup).

## Host-facts table

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | `beastie` |
| OS | Fedora Linux 43 (Workstation Edition) |
| Kernel | 6.18.4-200.fc43.x86_64 |
| Landlock | present in LSM set, kernel ≥ 5.13 → **enforces** (matters at stage 2, when the agent applies its in-process filesystem sandbox; a no-op below 5.13) |
| CPU | 32 vCPU — AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 w/ Radeon 8060S (16 cores × 2 threads) |
| RAM | 125 GiB (+ 8 GiB swap) |
| Disk | `/dev/nvme0n1p3` — 1.9 TB NVMe, ~1.5 TB free; `/` and `/home` share it |
| Container runtime | rootless **Podman 5.7.1** |
| Compose | genuine compose v2 binary `docker-compose v5.3.1` at `~/.local/bin/docker-compose`, driving Podman's Docker-compatible API socket via `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`. **Not** podman-compose (its `depends_on: service_healthy` is unreliable; migrations ordering needs it). |
| Rootless socket | user unit `podman.socket` enabled; `loginctl` **linger enabled** (containers/timers survive SSH logout) |
| Network position | Postgres bound **loopback-only** (`127.0.0.1:5432`); no inbound ports |
| Recovery path | team SSH (keys only) = the human-only, agent-free out-of-band path (§Recovery) |
| SELinux | enforcing → all compose bind mounts carry `:ro,Z` (rootless relabel) |

Reference sizing for a full hive is 16 vCPU / 64 GB / 1 TB (1.1 §5.1); Beastie exceeds it,
and the deployment-#0 substrate slice needs far less.

## Lockfile (code provenance — the deployment's identity)

| Component | Pin |

Push to a registry and pin the RepoDigest before any multi-host deployment. |

## Acceptance + deployment checks (green)

- **Acceptance run** (port spec §9 / §7 step 6): `seed` → `coordinator`+`worker`+`review` as three separate containers coordinating only through Postgres via the port → terminal board `{t1: done, t2: done}`; read back via `board-view`.
- **Deployment checks 1–5** (`scripts/deploy_checks.sh`): (1) acceptance terminal; (2) migration idempotence; (3) snapshot+restore replays an identical log; (4) tier-routing / no ungoverned route; (5) credential scope. **5/5 pass.**
- **In-container CI**: 183 tests + ruff + mypy green via `compose run test|lint`.

## Backup

- Containerized `pg_dump` from the pinned postgres image (`compose --profile ops run --rm backup` → `scripts/pg_backup.sh` → timestamped SQL in the `omegahive-backups` volume). **Drilled once** (Jul 7 2026: `omegahive-20260707T194853Z.sql`).
- Scheduled via a **systemd user timer** (`deploy/systemd/omegahive-backup.{service,timer}`, daily 03:00, `Persistent=true`). Install (operator, one-time):
  ```sh
  cp deploy/systemd/omegahive-backup.* ~/.config/systemd/user/
  systemctl --user daemon-reload
  systemctl --user enable --now omegahive-backup.timer
  ```
  Linger is already enabled, so the timer runs without an active login session.

## Restore drill

The snapshot+restore path is exercised by deployment check 3 (dump → restore into a
scratch DB → event-level equality of the replayed log). Full procedure in the recovery
runbook. Interim cursor rule until the generation-token bump is wired into a live run:
**restore ⇒ restart every client, no exceptions.**

## Forward notes (arrive with later stages, not #0)

- **Stage 2** adds the pinned OmegaClaw fork image; re-run the deployment checks. Verify the runtime's seccomp default permits the `landlock_*` syscalls (the agent sandboxes itself in-process) — a one-time container check, recorded here when done.
- **Stage 4** adds the two-role DB split (reader vs gateway INSERT — T1 check 6) and the network-route layer of the tier-routing check (real outbound capability). Deployment #0 has no outbound at all, so only the gateway layer of check 4 is asserted here.
- The omegahive image is a local build; before any second host, push it and pin the RepoDigest in this lockfile.
